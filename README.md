# Vehicle Builder

## Description
This project is a typeScript command-line application that generates a build for a car, truck or motorbike. The command prompt will ask the user to make a choice between creating a new or pre-exisiting vehicle. Once created, the user can cycle through various manuevering options, towing capabiliy, and even the chance to do a wheelie. Finally, the user can select 'exit' to end the command-line application.
